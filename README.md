# ECHO-EYE: Third Eye for the Blind

An innovative assistive device designed to enhance mobility and safety for visually impaired individuals.  
This Arduino-based wearable system detects obstacles using ultrasonic sensors and provides real-time feedback through a buzzer or vibration motor.

## 🧠 Project Overview

The "Third Eye for Blind" aims to offer a low-cost, efficient, and user-friendly alternative to traditional tools like white canes and guide dogs.  
By leveraging affordable components like the Arduino Uno, HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, and a buzzer, this device helps users detect and avoid nearby obstacles.

## 🚀 Features

- Obstacle detection using ultrasonic sensors (up to 4 meters)
- Varying buzzer feedback based on obstacle distance
- Optional vibration feedback for tactile alerts
- Compact and wearable design
- Arduino Uno based (open-source, customizable)
- Low-cost (under ₹1500 / $20)

## 🧰 Components Used

- Arduino Uno board
- Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)
- Buzzer
- 9V battery or USB power
- Breadboard & jumper wires
- (Optional) Vibration motor

## 💻 Code

The Arduino code activates the buzzer with different beep intervals depending on the distance to an obstacle:
- < 15 cm: Fast beep + vibration
- 15–25 cm: Medium beep
- 25–40 cm: Slow beep
- > 40 cm: No alert

## 📄 Included File

- miniproject_r1.pdf: Detailed project report (design, objectives, literature review, code, results)

## 📈 Future Enhancements

- Integrate piezoelectric energy harvesting from walking
- Use AI for object recognition and voice-based navigation
- Add Bluetooth or GSM module for emergency alerts
